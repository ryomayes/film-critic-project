catherine-bray,fresh,4/5,the_cabinet_of_dr_caligari,"Pre-dating even early genre landmarks Nosferatu (1922) and Metropolis (1926) by some distance, Robert Wiene's silent film is both influential and one of a kind.",The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari) (1920)

catherine-bray,rotten,1.5/5,10009151-box,"Think very carefully before you attempt to unlock the mysteries of The Box. There is no going back, you cannot undo your decision, you will never get back those 115 minutes, and by the horrifying end, those same 115 minutes will feel like a life sentence.",The Box (2009)
catherine-bray,fresh,4.5/5,cold_souls,"For those who like Charlie Kaufman on paper but occasionally find themselves a little tested by his self-conscious meanderings in practice, the hilarious Cold Souls is a pleasingly tight and subtle execution of an eye-opening concept.",Cold Souls (2009)

catherine-bray,fresh,3/5,1190561-imaginarium_of_doctor_parnassus,"A eulogy, a polemic, an intriguing mess: Dr Parnassus is ultimately more worth your time than many a polished creation, and it's a must for Terry Gilliam completists, but this time out he delivers a feast for the eyes more than he satisfies intellectually",The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009)
catherine-bray,rotten,2/5,10011457-ong_bak_2_2009,"Tony Jaa is a martial arts star. Is he a director? No. The dull plotting and predictable characters in Ong Bak: The Beginning all but overwhelms Jaa doing what he does best, which is fighting.",Ong Bak 2 (2009)

catherine-bray,rotten,1.5/5,1213718-did_you_hear_about_the_morgans,"Hugh, what a stinker!

catherine-bray,rotten,2/5,1218219-passchendaele,A kind of Canadian World War I version of Pearl Harbor recast with TV actors and made on a tenth of the budget - yet for all that more endearing than Pearl Harbour.,Passchendaele (2008)
catherine-bray,fresh,4/5,10009823-sin_nombre,"Sin Nombre is a spry, humane account of the hardships encountered on the Mexican immigration trail, whose violence never feels exploitative, for all that it may be hard to watch. Highly recommended.",Sin Nombre (2009)

catherine-bray,fresh,3.5/5,10011284-skin,"An admirably understated central performance from Sophie Okenedo, supported by a fine cast, gives a human face to this true-life race relations drama, which never over-simplifies in favour of easy emotional wins.",Skin (2009)
catherine-bray,fresh,3.5/5,harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince,"Too deep into the saga to win over any Potter virgins, this is payback for those who've followed the series from the start, with some of what was good about the books making a comfortable transition to screen.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)
catherine-bray,fresh,3/5,1219885-ichi,"Ultimately a romp, albeit one with some entertaining quirks and a strange melancholy undertow, we shouldn't make overly high-falutin' claims for Ichi, but fans of balletic fight scenes should get a kick out of some good-looking sequences.",Ichi (2008)
catherine-bray,fresh,4/5,1207748-katyn,"Delivering an emotional punch to the gut in the final reel, this engaging account of an under-reported tragedy will remind you how cinema can still rise to the occasion and go beyond the empty bangs and flashes of tent pole releases.",Katyn (2009)
catherine-bray,rotten,2/5,beyond_the_fire_2009,"Quite simply one of the more embarrassing films we've ever seen, Beyond The Fire is bad in a way that only a film aspiring to deal with a serious, sensitive subject and falling flat on its face can be.",Beyond The Fire (2009)
