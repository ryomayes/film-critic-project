matt-brunson,fresh,3/4,the_raid_2,"The hoary storyline of a cop posing as a criminal in order to infiltrate a powerful mob family has been used on countless occasions, but that's because it's both irresistible and intense. The Raid 2 does it justice.",The Raid 2 (2014)

matt-brunson,fresh,3/4,comme_un_chef,"In the world of culinary cinema, if Babette's Feast is a 10-oz. filet mignon and Eat Drink Man Woman is a 4-lb. lobster, then this French import registers as a delectable bonbon, small and insignificant but nevertheless sweet and satisfying.",Comme un chef (Le Chef) (2014)
matt-brunson,fresh,3/4,captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014,"It imports so many cast members from The Avengers that it almost feels like the Age of Ultron is already upon us.

matt-brunson,fresh,3/4,non_stop_2013,"This film isn't straight-up fisticuffs and firearms, as it also contains an old-fashioned mystery in the whodunnit vein. Hence, it's more Murder on the Orient Express and less Snakes on a Plane.",Non-Stop (2014)

matt-brunson,rotten,1.5/4,tank_girl,Rachel Talalay's hyper direction and Lori Petty's hyper performance result in migraines; you also get an unrecognizable Ice-T as the most antagonistic of the Rippers and Iggy Pop in a fleeting cameo as a pervert with a penchant for 10-year-old girls.,Tank Girl (1995)

matt-brunson,fresh,4/4,all_the_presidents_men,"This superb film has long been acknowledged as a classic political thriller, but watching it in today's climate, at a point when a timid and ineffectual media is par for the course, also reveals its increasingly significant value as a time capsule piece.",All the President's Men (1976)
