robert-davis,fresh,3.5/5,prairie_home_companion,"Altman's star-studded cast is natural and energetic -- with the exception of a surprisingly detached Keillor -- and the Hollywood folks mingle easily, in character, among the real show's performers, a technique Altman perfected in Nashville.",A Prairie Home Companion (2006)
robert-davis,fresh,4/5,the_death_of_mr_lazarescu,"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu seems effortlessly observed, even improvised, but it's actually a wonder of choreography, rhythm and social commentary.",The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2006)
robert-davis,rotten,2.5/5,art_school_confidential,"Unfortunately, the tender observations Zwigoff and Clowes specialize in are largely missing from Art School Confidential, which spends its energy on the zany people who'd usually pepper the edges of their films.",Art School Confidential (2006)
robert-davis,fresh,4.5/5,cache_2005,"Michael Haneke's aptly named Caché (Hidden) is the kind of movie that fully engages the mind of the viewer. It's a multi-layered, open-ended thriller, an onion sliced by taut piano wire.",Caché (2005)
robert-davis,fresh,,mongol,"[It's] as good as most of this year's American would-be blockbusters, but it might've been far more interesting if the filmmakers had either left the Hollywood mold or embraced it with reckless abandon.",Mongol (2008)

robert-davis,fresh,3/5,1107793-silence,"The boy's blindness often seems like either a novelty or a symbol; in either case, its falseness weakens the overall effect, even though the film easily has a dozen charming, memorable scenes.",The Silence (Sokout) (1999)
robert-davis,fresh,3.5/5,batman_begins,"Not only do we see Gotham in the daylight, but Christian Bale may also be the first Bruce Wayne who's more at home crouching in a monastery with his hair in his eyes than attending a dinner party for which he'd have to trim his nails.",Batman Begins (2005)

robert-davis,fresh,3.5/5,the_counterfeiters_2007,"Karl Markovics is exceptionally well cast. He's not wildly expressive, but his physicality -- a small frame, a nose that bends northwest due to events we can only imagine -- is enough to carry the film's ambiguities.",The Counterfeiters (2007)

robert-davis,fresh,,italian,"With a tensed brow, Kolya Spiridonov plays a boy perpetually hovering between anxiety and dogged determination, and the film walks the same line, unsure about where it's going but always moving forward regardless.",The Italian (2007)

robert-davis,rotten,1.5/5,10000_bc,"But the folks who made 10,000 B.C. have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst.","10,000 B.C. (2008)"

robert-davis,rotten,2/5,eros_2005,"The chatter in the lobby, I predict, will be from people wondering how and when [Antonioni] flipped his lid... The film is a failure, no matter how grandiose its title or the names above it.",Eros (2004)
robert-davis,rotten,2/5,in_the_realms_of_the_unreal,"The camera is too eager to swim in the artist's sea, but it might've revealed more if it had paused to let our imaginations provide the movement, as Darger's presumably did.",In the Realms of the Unreal (2005)
robert-davis,fresh,4.5/5,1152954-new_world,"[Malick's] characters must consider their lives, consider each other, and resolve the situation like adults. And when they do, a story that seemed to be irredeemably broken snaps back together.",The New World (2005)

robert-davis,rotten,2/5,grace_is_gone,"The power of the ending comes from the inherent pain of loss, but it's no feat to recognize how emotional this would be, to tell us it's coming and to dangle it in front of us for an hour and a half.",Grace Is Gone (2007)
robert-davis,rotten,,stop_loss,"It strokes every personal ideal, whatever it is, rather than aligning itself with its characters and letting the conclusions arise out of who they are.",Stop-Loss (2008)

robert-davis,fresh,,forbidden_kingdom,"If The Forbidden Kingdom missteps, it's by assuming that its digitally enhanced stunts are more impressive than they are and, therefore, lavishing more attention on the kinetics than the story.",The Forbidden Kingdom (2008)

robert-davis,fresh,,bamako_2007,Sissako's bolt of lightning is how he once again merges spaces: he sets the trial out-of-doors... editing the village's daily events as if they are all a part of the trial's fabric.,Bamako (2006)

robert-davis,fresh,,son_of_rambow,"The boys' video project is modern enough to stand in contrast to the brick and tweed of the locale, but rather than glossing over that uncomfortable fit, Jennings highlights it with a one-man Flock Of Seagulls.",Son of Rambow (2007)
robert-davis,fresh,4/5,manderlay,"It doesn't offer much insight into America's race issues, which might seem at first to be its target, but it works very well as a metaphor for America's intervention in Iraq.",Manderlay (2006)

robert-davis,fresh,3.5/5,five_obstructions,[Leth's] strength against adversity elevates the movie above the one-sided whipping of a genial man to a more interesting duel of filmmakers. He parries when von Trier thrusts.,The Five Obstructions (2003)

robert-davis,fresh,3.5/5,corporation,"As a clever joke, the filmmakers run down a list of the traits of a psychopath and find a corporate action to match each one. Diagnosis: psychopath. It's cute, but it's a logical fallacy.",The Corporation (2004)

robert-davis,fresh,2.5/5,girl_with_a_pearl_earring,"The movie benefits greatly from Johansson's gift for understated delivery, but she's less assured in this demure, largely non-verbal role than she was as a modern young woman in Ghost World and Lost in Translation.",Girl With a Pearl Earring (2004)
robert-davis,fresh,4.5/5,the_son_2003,"It's a clear-eyed style of filmmaking reminiscent of The Decalogue or The Bicycle Thief, movies that adopt a raw, bare-bones aesthetic to capture the difficult morality of everyday life.",The Son (2003)

robert-davis,fresh,56/100,10010667-hangover,"While I'm not ready to call the film a triumph, its approach to humor is smart enough to benefit greatly from low expectations. Which is to say, it's an enjoyable piece of trash.",The Hangover (2009)
robert-davis,fresh,85/100,forbidden-lie-forbidden-lies,"Thankfully, both filmmaker and subject approach the film as a duel. Broinowski thrusts, Khouri parries. Finding out what, if anything, is true about Khouri's story is simply the Macguffin for a filmmaker more thrilled by the hunt.",Forbidden Lie$ (Forbidden Lies) (2007)
robert-davis,fresh,78/100,away_we_go,"Away We Go breathes. Its affectless, tossed-off quality tells a lumpy story built out of a few scenes that fizzle but also a few that transcend, in part because they arrive unexpectedly from an untidy little comedy.",Away We Go (2009)

robert-davis,fresh,65/100,1189217-angels_and_demons,"Tom Hanks chases the Will Shortz of sacrilege and death in Angels & Demons, which is better than The Da Vinci Code in every way but one. It's more fun, it's less dumb, but: it has no Ian McKellan.",Angels & Demons (2009)
robert-davis,fresh,90/100,10009355-sugar,"Some of the surprise of seeing a major new talent appear from thin air is lost in even a strong sophomore effort, but Boden and Fleck have set and met a high standard for their work. I found it sublime.",Sugar (2008)
robert-davis,fresh,70/100,10009334-the_escapist,"It's swifter, grittier, and louder than the typical escape movie, but it still falls firmly within the tradition of underground breakouts. Its contrapuntal timelines are twisted into a surprisingly elegant first feature.",The Escapist (2008)

robert-davis,rotten,41/100,crossing_over,The film plods along until late in the game when its mystery story is resolved with three nested flashbacks by a filmmaker with a markedly unimaginative sense of cinematic storytelling.,Crossing Over (2009)
robert-davis,fresh,69/100,seraphine,"During the film I craved energy, but by the end I realized that I just wanted a story that stood a bit closer to its interesting, well-played title character and a bit further from the time-marking events of historical drama.",Séraphine (2009)

robert-roten,fresh,C+,without_shepherds,"This is a film, shot over a two year period in Pakistan, paints a picture of life in Pakistan through portraits of six people.

robert-roten,fresh,B,kong_skull_island,"The visual effects and the acting are solid. There is also plenty of action and the pace is fast. This is basically a popcorn movie with some humor in it.

robert-roten,fresh,B,get_out,"While it is too violent for my taste, it does have some clever comic touches and an interesting racial twist on the usual horror genre story. It is kind of like a dark comic cross between '12 Years a Slave' and 'The Man With Two Brains.'",Get Out (2017)

robert-roten,fresh,C+,atomic_blonde_2017,"As far as action goes, this is a decent action film, like a James Bond film with some John Wickisms thrown in. The body count is very high.

robert-roten,fresh,B,the_lost_city_of_z,Both the story of Fawcett's adventures and his family life are effectively told by writer-director James Gray . This is the kind of movie that makes you want to research the people and events depicted and find out more about them.,The Lost City of Z (2017)
robert-roten,fresh,B,a_street_cat_named_bob,"Veteran director Roger Spottiswoode, best known for 'Tomorrow Never Dies' and 'The 6th Day' also has experience with this kind of movie and he handles this story just right by not letting it get too sentimental or melodramatic.",A Street Cat Named Bob (2016)
robert-roten,fresh,C+,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2,"I found the plot not as tight as the first film, and the humor and sentimentality seemed a bit forced this time around.
