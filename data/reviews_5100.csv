jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_mercy,The heart-breaking true story of British amateur sailor Donald Crowhurst is told here in painstaking detail by director James Marsh who has succeeded in bringing us the saddest film we've seen in yonks. Nobody does noble failure like the Brits.,The Mercy (2017)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,samsara_2012,"Mesmerising, impressionistic movie in which time-lapse photography...is intended to ignite thoughts about the meaning of life, society, technology, God, ecology and robots.",Samsara (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,sightseers,"Deftly directed by Ben Wheatley (whose fright-fest Kill List is a must on DVD)...the film is careful not to make light of violence, using comedy to sharpen its sinister edge",Sightseers (2013)

jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,wreck_it_ralph,"This A-grade animated Disney charmer hits the nail on the head...director Rich Moore has enormous faith in the ability of young audiences to absorb multiple story strands at once, a belief aided no end by the exquisite quality of the animation.",Wreck-it Ralph (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey,There is simply not enough story to justify the inordinate length...the enormous production effort is negated by [the] disastrous decision to shoot at 48 frames per second...This makes the entire enterprise look like the world's most expensive home video.,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,you_will_meet_a_tall_dark_stranger,"It's one of Allen's lesser films yet, as is so often the case with his B-material, it still features terrific performances...and a cluster of truth-nailing scenes that are better than what you typically find in major releases.",You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010)
jim-schembri,rotten,1.5/5,this_is_40,"More aptly known as ""This is 40 Minutes Too Long"", Judd Apatow's comic attempt at a bitter-sweet comic dissertation about middle-age falls flat.",This is 40 (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,4/5,compliance_2012,This little independent American film might be the scariest thing you see this year...a shattering film about human psychology of which the young Martin Scorsese would have been proud.,Compliance (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,2.5/5,west_of_memphis,It's reasonable to question whether the time and resources poured into this project might have been better spent highlighting a miscarriage of American justice that nobody knows about rather than one that enjoys a celebrity profile.,West of Memphis (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2.5/5,anna_karenina_2012,"Leo Tolstoy's classic tale of doomed romance and the emotionally stifling lives of Russian aristocrats gets an ornate, inert reworking...the congested setting makes much of the film look like a blur of costumes and set dressing.",Anna Karenina (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,paranorman,"ParaNorman demonstrates - as did films such as Coraline, The Corpse Bride, Wallace & Gromit and The Nightmare Before Christmas - that stop-motion animation has a texture and warmth that can't (yet!) be replicated by computer.",ParaNorman (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,paris_manhattan,First-time director Sophie Lellouche keeps this puff pastry-thin piece of romantic fluff as light and inconsequential as it needs to be.,Paris Manhattan (2013)

jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,trouble_with_the_curve,"Director Robert Lorenz does a proficient, if unremarkable job corralling all the cliches into a pleasing, predictable package...And let's face it: nobody serves out a big, well-deserved dose of comeuppance like Clint. Even without a gun.",Trouble with the Curve (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,4.5/5,the_sessions,Australian veteran writer/director Ben Lewin (The Dunera Boys) delivers a heartfelt gem that is as moving as it is unassuming. It easily chimes in as one of the films of the year.,The Sessions (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,god_bless_america_2011,"Enjoyable, over-the-top, and nowhere near as black as the premise sounds, God Bless America is essentially an extended comic op-ed piece.",God Bless America (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,robot_and_frank,"First-time director Jake Schreier never forces the gentle emotional undertow that explores aging and dementia, the result being a charming, touching ode to elderly people and the humanist potential of technology.",Robot & Frank (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_2,"The big payoff to the Twilight saga is a solidly mounted, carefully directed exercise in franchise box-ticking... Even the decapitations are done tastefully.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012)

jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,red_dawn_2012,"Unfortunately unexciting remake of the 1984 junk-culture cult classic about a bunch of American teens who fight back after America is invaded by Communists. Yes, Communists... This could have been fun.",Red Dawn (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,fun_size,"Here's yet another example of a DVD film inexplicably receiving a full-on cinema release...It doesn't help that Victoria Justice, pretty as she is, does not exactly ignite the screen with comic charisma.",Fun Size (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,sound_of_my_voice,"A cracker of a film about the seductive power of cults... the film rides largely on the haunting, compelling presence of Marling.",Sound of My Voice (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_angels_share,"This is as close to a feel-good film as [director] Ken Loach gets, yet he never loses sight or touch with the reality he is so brilliant at capturing on camera.",The Angels' Share (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower,"While most films about teenage life tend to trade on a nifty hook, and sometimes even a plot, The Perks of Being a Wallflower chimes in as an unusually incisive, character-driven ramble through the inevitable awkwardness of teen life.",The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,celeste_and_jesse_forever,"The film bears a kinship with the underrated 2006 film The Break-Up; both are, for lack of a better term, post-romantic comedies by exploring the largely virgin territory of what happens long after the meet-cute, when life takes hold and love goes sour.",Celeste and Jesse Forever (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_man_with_the_iron_fists,"The fists, feet and digital blood go flying in this enjoyable, frenetic, largely forgettable chop-socky extravaganza about, well, about a man with iron fists who gets into lots of fights.",The Man With the Iron Fists (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,the_master_2011,There are gaping chasms in the story and side stories that go nowhere. Yet the power of [Philip Seymour] Hoffman's performance is so hypnotic you forgive the film's faults just to revel in his all-consuming portrayal of a man possessed by his own beliefs.,The Master (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,lincoln_2011,"Oddly, Spielberg chooses to set his gabby epic largely indoors...This gives Lincoln a rather inert feel...It's infuriating that spectacular battle scenes are described in the film, but not shown.",Lincoln (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,cirque_du_soleil_worlds_away,"Designed as pure confection for the eyes, this largely wordless fare is perfect for kids (how many G-rated films are there around?) and for any stressed-out office worker eager for something to unwind to.",Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,roman_polanski_a_film_memoir_2012,"Polanski sure knows how to spin a yarn, whether it's with words or film.",Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,2.5/5,21_and_over,"It's crude, gross, tasteless and made with an almost alarming degree of drive and conviction...the film is undeniably lewd, but can't be faulted for being boring or politically correct...And you have to somehow admire that.",21 And Over (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,goddess_2012,"This bright, locally made, rice cracker-thin musical comedy is a pleasant, diverting way to kill two hours..Some thoughtful scenes about the dilemma women too-often face between personal and professional success help ground the film's breezy, joyful tone.",Goddess (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,flight_of_the_butterflies,At the preview...the 3D effect had scores of kids reaching out to touch the butterflies. It was as gorgeous a sight to behold as anything on the giant Imax screen.,Flight of the Butterflies (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_loneliest_planet,"Writer/director Julia Loktev, a New York filmmaker born in Russia, skilfully uses stillness and the vastness of the Caucasus Mountains to frame her trio of characters in psychological quicksand.",The Loneliest Planet (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,jack_the_giant_slayer,"Thanks to the marvel of digital visual effects and the clear influence of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, [director Bryan] Singer does a terrific job showing us just how realistic a battle set in a fantasy world can look.",Jack the Giant Slayer (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,a_good_day_to_die_hard,"Undeniably entertaining action-movie franchise fodder [but] had the producers [made] Mary Elizabeth Winstead the film's other action hero rather than going with the convention of casting yet another male, Die Hard 5 would have been awesome.",A Good Day To Die Hard (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,2.5/5,amour_2013,"While [director Michael] Haneke's love of long takes invite you to stare into the corrugated faces of Georges and Anne as their worlds change, there is a leaden quality to many stretches of the film that assume a profundity that simply isn't there.",Amour (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,zambezia,"The splendid Madagascar films might have spolied us somewhat when it comes to African cartoon animals, but there is enough action and heart in the story to keep things aloft, especially during the big battle climax.",Zambezia (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,escape_from_planet_earth_2013,"A ripper sci-fi comedy adventure guaranteed to galvanize the attention of the red-cordial crowd...delightful, pastel-coloured, busy piece of bubble-gum kids' cinema has fun playing up all the alien conspiracy theories.",Escape From Planet Earth (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,de_rouille_et_dos_2012,"The notion of strings-free sex gets a good working over from director Jacques Audiard (A Prophet), who takes as much pride in exploring the workings of Stephanie's troubled mind as he does in digitally removing her legs.",De rouille et d'os (Rust and Bone) (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,1/5,the_host_2013,"This limply directed, solidly boring slice of sci-fi twaddle features humanoid aliens who spend much of their screen time staring blankly into the middle distance with glazed eyes. About 10 minutes into this dross, you'll know what that feels like.",The Host (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,the-croods,"As well as being pacy, energetically animated and stuffed full of modern-day references, The Croods also casts off any lingering doubt that DreamWorks is moving into the character-driven domain normally dominated by Pixar.",The Croods (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,gi_joe_retaliation,"Dizzyingly entertaining celebration of fireballs, wire-assisted martial arts and high-calibre firepower has more grace and poise than Die Hard 5...will surely make up for those disappointed with the so-so 2009 film.",G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,return_to_nims_island,"This message-driven film is perfectly fine for kids around 10, though it is a little light on humour. Adults accompanying said kids, though, are strongly advised not to think too hard as the predictable tale unfolds.",Return To Nim's Island (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,sleepwalk_with_me_2012,"Though the sleep-walking episodes are funny, it's the way Mike Birbiglia captures the pains of performing comedy to tiny rooms that really fly.",Sleepwalk With Me (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2.5/5,identity_thief,"Formulaic multiplex mulch, way over-long, often feels strained...That said, Identity Thief is the latest example of the disconnect that often exists between critical opinion and popular appeal. Slammed by critics the low-budget film has been a huge hit.",Identity Thief (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,hyde_park_on_hudson,"It's been a long time since Lost in Translation (2003), which is the last time Bill Murray did anything of real note in a film. Here he partially redeems the latter phase of his film career playing pre-war US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.",Hyde Park on Hudson (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,last_stand_2013,"Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.",The Last Stand (2013)
jim-schembri,rotten,1/5,beautiful_creatures_2013,"Any hope of tapping into the Twilight vibe is pretty much neutered by the film's haphazard storyline, stuttering pace and inordinate length.",Beautiful Creatures (2013)

jim-schembri,rotten,0/5,movie_43,"It's a full-scale disaster, a misfire of megalithic proportions that somehow managed to snare an A-list cast...The reviews have been so relentlessly acidic that it could acquire a so-bad-it's-fun mystique that turns it into a cult film.",Movie 43 (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,silver_linings_playbook,Director David O. Russell is a little too chipper at times - breaking a restraining order is really no joke - but he brings a breeziness to this likeable tale of two misfits trying to make it work.,Silver Linings Playbook (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,4/5,flight_2012,"The powerful pull of the bottle is conveyed with considerable force...The character fits Washington like a tailored strait-jacket, possibly because he's worn it before.",Flight (2012)

jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,the_incredible_burt_wonderstone,"What a wash-out this film is...Sadly, and in yet another example supporting the Theory of Comedy Negation, the great casting mysteriously works against itself to produce far-from-great comedy.",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,a_late_quartet,The ever-impressive [Philip Seymour] Hoffman - as effortlessly good an ensemble player as he is a leading man - stands out as the flawed violinist who has trouble controlling his id.,A Late Quartet (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,great_expectations_2012,"Helena Bonham Carter does something with Miss Havisham that Martita Hunt couldn't quite manage in the brilliant 1946 David Lean film; namely, make it feel as though she never changed out of that damned wedding dress.",Great Expectations (2013)
jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,blinder,"Director Richard Gray (Summer Coda) has his hands full trying to do justice to the story's moral minefield while putting in enough slo-mo footy action...Regrettably, this results in a well-meaning muddle of a film.",Blinder (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,i_give_it_a_year,"As with Bridesmaids, Rose Byrne proves herself to be naturally funny, and the film is definitely cliche-averse: there is no way the story's final act would have survived the American test screening process.",I Give It a Year (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,4/5,cloud_atlas_2012,"An epic, genre-hopping, unique adventure that effectively shoe-horns six films into one...Cloud Atlas achieves that rarest of all things for a film this big: it is engaging and consistently entertaining as well as providing brain food.",Cloud Atlas (2012)

jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,hansel_and_gretel_witch_hunters,"It's silly, sure. Trouble is, it's not silly enough...The action sequences are a let down; mostly shot in swish pans, the loss of brightness that comes with 3D makes much of the movie look like a murky blur.",Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)
jim-schembri,rotten,1.5/5,trance_2013,"Director Danny Boyle goes off the boil with this meandering Inception wannabe... far from being a clever, tense heist-film-with-a-twist Trance is a laboured, over-stylised slice of pseudo-psychological babble. And it's kind of dull.",Trance (2013)
jim-schembri,fresh,4/5,jesus_christ_superstar_live_arena_tour,"The real revelation here is the astounding, stellar performance by Australian comedian Tim Minchin. Playing it straight as Judas Iscariot, he frames the story as one of misplaced faith, betrayed ideals and the perils of authority.",Jesus Christ Superstar: Live Arena Tour (2012)
jim-schembri,rotten,2/5,seven_psychopaths,"Despite a great cast, a great premise and some great ham acting - a must whenever Christopher Walken walks into frame - the movie's lack of focus keeps it from kicking out of second gear and into the kind of crazy groove it clearly strives for.",Seven Psychopaths (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,bernie_2011,"The real gold here is the performance centrepiece by Black; he delivers a lovable, highly nuanced portrayal of a man who is hard not to feel sympathy for, even if it does grind against your conscience.",Bernie (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,the_bourne_legacy,"The film is too well-made and too well-paced to reek of cynicism...But rather than leaving you yearning for yet more Bourne, this exhausting fourth installment is more likely to have you citing one of the clearly stated themes in the film: ""no more"".",The Bourne Legacy (2012)
jim-schembri,fresh,3.5/5,barrymore,"Erik Canuel, who directed and adapted the work, employs a host of cinematic techniques to enhance Plummer's spell-binding turn as a crotchety has-been who, in 1942, attempts to revive his career by playing Richard III.",Barrymore (2012)

jim-schembri,fresh,3/5,damsels_in_distress,"While the highly mannered banter on show here doesn't quite have the cutting ring of Whit Stillman's] epocal, yuppie-era conversation piece Metropolitan (1990), it brims with dry wit and wry observations about college life and awkward emotions.",Damsels in Distress (2012)
