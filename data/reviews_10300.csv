tom-coates,fresh,3/5,escape_from_the_planet_of_the_apes,It works fairly well as the central movie of the franchise but will have little to offer non-devotees.,Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)
tom-coates,rotten,2/5,battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"The Planet of the Apes series started well, and gradually decreased in budget and quality. By Battle the budget is all but gone, and all the believability and excitement has gone with it.",Battle For The Planet Of The Apes (1973)
tom-coates,rotten,3/5,mars_attacks,"Mars Attacks! wants to be the Dr Strangelove of alien B-movies, but isn't up to the challenge. Instead it's a paceless, overlong, and campy film partly redeemed by a number of hilarious and gruesome alien invasion skits.",Mars Attacks! (1996)
tom-coates,fresh,3/5,girl_interrupted,"You're left wishing the film had a little more faith in its audience, for then this well-put-together movie might have provoked more thought, and slightly less irritation.","Girl, Interrupted (1999)"
tom-coates,rotten,1/5,man_with_the_golden_gun,"There's no shortage of innuendo, action, exotic locations, or casual misogyny. Unfortunately it's too camp and cruel an adventure to raise more than a Moore-like eyebrow.",The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)

tom-coates,rotten,2/5,star_trek_generations,"The plot holes are obvious and disconcerting, the sub-plots feel tacked-on, and the characters are both thinly-drawn and badly-played.",Star Trek Generations (1994)
tom-coates,fresh,3/5,living_daylights,A pure back-to-basics action-adventure spy drama which mostly delivers.,The Living Daylights (1987)
tom-coates,fresh,3/5,superman_ii,"Substantial credit should also go to Terence Stamp's casually menacing General Zod, who transcends his terrible costume and make-up to appear a convincing threat.",Superman II (1981)
tom-coates,rotten,3/5,1015373-oceans_eleven,"There are just too many main characters for any of them to develop any depth, too many shots of casino signs sparkling in the night, and too little pace and plot to pull the whole thing together.",Ocean's Eleven (1960)
tom-coates,fresh,4/5,1021112-texas_chainsaw_massacre,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't try anything funny, there are no winks to the audience. And it's all the better because of it.",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)
