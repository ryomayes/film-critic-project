nick-setchfield,fresh,4.5/5,captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014,"Fundamentally, this is a superhero movie with something to say. In fact it's the first Marvel entry with a truly topical sting.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)

nick-usen,fresh,3/4,iceberg_slim_portrait_of_a_pimp,"It certainly threatens to succumb to hero worship, but Jorge Hinojosa wisely subverts Slim's mythos by pulling the curtain back on it in the doc's second half by revealing the man beneath.",Iceberg Slim: Portrait Of A Pimp (2013)
