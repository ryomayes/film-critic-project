jason-bechervaise,fresh,,train_to_busan,"An entertaining ride, as well as providing political commentary when it overtly references the Korean government's response to the MERS virus alongside commenting on the country's class system.",Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) (2016)
jason-bechervaise,fresh,,the_wailing,"Its sheer intensity and ambiguous narrative might put off some viewers, but this latest film could well be regarded as one of the best films to emerge from Korea in recent years.",The Wailing (Goksung) (2016)
jason-bechervaise,fresh,,cheol_won_gi_haeng,Kim Bo-ram's cinematography plays an instrumental part in differentiating the feature from the conventional melodrama as they exploit the picturesque snow-filled landscape to help give the film a more contemplative tone.,Cheol-won-gi-haeng (End of Winter) (2015)
jason-bechervaise,fresh,,the_handmaiden,"The whole cast delivers mesmerizing performances. Kim Min-hee is on the best form of her career following her role in Hong Sang-soo's Right Now, Wrong Then.",The Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi) (2016)
jason-bechervaise,fresh,,on_the_beach_at_night_alone,The striking similarities between this film - about an actress who has an affair with a married film director - and the intense local speculation surrounding Hong's own private life distinguishes it from the renowned auteur's other work.,On the Beach at Night Alone (Bamui haebyun-eoseo honja) (2017)
jason-bechervaise,rotten,,claires_camera,It ultimately feels dashed and somewhat shallow.,Claire's Camera (La caméra de Claire) (2018)

jason-bechervaise,fresh,,long_way_north,"While it doesn't sail into new territory, Long Way North is told in an enchanting manner with equal focus on the animation as well as strong character development.",Long Way North (Tout en haut du monde) (2016)
jason-best,fresh,,lincoln_2011,"The actual vote on the Amendment proves surprisingly gripping, but elsewhere moments of piety and sentimentality undermine Day-Lewis's magnificent, credibly flesh-and-blood Lincoln.",Lincoln (2012)

jason-best,rotten,,ice_age_continental_drift,"The swashbuckling stuff is boisterous, if dated, and proves far more engaging than a tedious sub-plot involving Manny's rebellious teenage daughter.",Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,keith_lemon_the_film,"Full of nauseatingly puerile penis-enlargement and bodily fluid gags, the film pads out its mercifully brief running time with witless cameos from the likes of David Hasselhoff, Jedward, Jason Donovan, Peter Andre and several Spice Girls.",Keith Lemon: The Film (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,st_georges_day,"The film looks good, thanks to cinematographer Mike Southon's stylish camerawork, but the script is well dodgy.",St George's Day (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,the_girl_tv_2012,"Hitchcock fans have vigorously disputed the film's version of events (scripted by Gwyneth Hughes and sanctioned by the now-82-year-old Hedren herself), but on screen it makes for gripping viewing.",The Girl (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,zero_dark_thirty,"The viewer needs to stay sharp to stay on top of the details of the labyrinthine search, but Bigelow tackles the complex story with the same muscular urgency and incisive intelligence that won her an Oscar for The Hurt Locker.",Zero Dark Thirty (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,dredd,"Lean, mean and luridly violent, sci-fi action thriller Dredd does a much better job of bringing cult comic-book anti-hero Judge Dredd to the screen than the misfiring 1995 Sylvester Stallone version.",Dredd (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,django_unchained_2012,"Overlong, overblown and overly self-indulgent. But excess is what Tarantino does. And just as he won't put one word in his characters' mouths when he can have them utter 10; he won't dispatch a bad guy with one bullet when he can discharge a dozen.",Django Unchained (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,les_miserables_2012,"Even if you're no fan of the show and think the lyrics doggerel and the music dreary, it's hard not to be bowled over by the barnstorming gusto shown by director Tom Hooper and his cast.",Les Misérables (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,gangster_squad_2012,"Brash, loud & risibly anachronistic, Gangster Squad is flashier than a mobster's suit, but if you're not too fussy about finesse then this stylised crime film is a hugely entertaining cops 'n crooks romp through a cartoon-like version of 1940s LA history.",Gangster Squad (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,thats_my_boy,Crass comedy That's My Boy adds close-to-the-knuckle raunchiness to Sandler's usual mix of stupidity and sentimentality.,That's My Boy (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,step_up_revolution,The story is sappy and predictable... But the dancing has a freshness and vibrancy that's infectiously enjoyable.,Step Up Revolution (2012)

jason-best,rotten,,trouble_with_the_curve,A corny baseball drama whose story arc is as predictable as an easily caught fly ball.,Trouble with the Curve (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey,"When the dwarves turn up mob-handed, kicking off a night of boisterous revelry, the laboured jests and jollity seem to go on forever. And the combination of dwarves, forced humour and familiar faces off the telly turn the occasion into bad panto.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,beasts_of_the_southern_wild,A wondrously weird slice of Cajun magic realism... Beasts of the Southern Wild explodes with energy and colour. The Cajun rock score soars. And the film's young lead is astonishing.,Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,skyfall,"Mendes and his team have done an extremely canny job of combining old-school Bond with new innovations, showing respect for the series' heritage while also delivering some audacious surprises.",Skyfall (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,argo_2012,"Affleck skilfully turns the screw of suspense, gaining added traction from an extremely convincing recreation of the setting and period.",Argo (2012)
jason-best,fresh,3/5,the_sapphires_2012,"There are a few wobbles in the script, but O'Dowd's feckless charmer holds things together and he finds a sparky match in Mailman's strong-willed Gail.",The Sapphires (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,de_rouille_et_dos_2012,"Audiard's film is shot and acted in such a down-to-earth, naturalistic manner that the story and characters convince you of their emotional truth. Restrained rather than overblown, this is melodrama that isn't melodramatic.",De rouille et d'os (Rust and Bone) (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,room_237_2012,"Room 237 probably won't convert you into a believer of any of the theories expounded, but it will make you want to watch The Shining again. And when you do, you may well do a double take when you see Danny's Apollo 11 sweater.",Room 237 (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,seven_psychopaths,"Another gleefully dark comedy thriller from In Bruges creator Martin McDonagh featuring gabby killers, scabrously funny dialogue and moments of shocking violence.",Seven Psychopaths (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,the_master_2011,"Feral, hunched, his face like a clenched fist, Phoenix's Freddie is inarticulate and blocked where Hoffman's Dodd is extravagant, loquacious and smooth, although Dodd's sudden eruptions of anger suggests a possible kinship between them beneath the skin.",The Master (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,amour_2013,"Haneke's undeniably austere film doesn't offer any false consolation, but it remains tender and compassionate, and boasts brave, heart-rending performances from a pair of French screen icons.",Amour (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,sightseers,"For all the miles its nerdy murderers rack up in their caravan, Sightseers doesn't really go anywhere.",Sightseers (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,bullet_to_the_head,"A brisk, lean, straight-shooting throwback to the world of 1980s action thrillers, the film even has Sylvester Stallone as its lead, a veritable 80s throwback himself, and one whose current career seems permanently stuck on repeat.",Bullet to the Head (2013)
jason-best,fresh,3/5,jack_reacher,"Rosamund Pike's underwritten role mostly requires her to goggle at Reacher's deductive genius and swoon at his pecs, but even if Jack Reacher won't leave nonpartisan viewers weak at the knees it still delivers straightforward genre thrills.",Jack Reacher (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,take_this_waltz,"The gorgeous photography gives summertime Toronto a steamy, sexy glow and the music (including the Leonard Cohen song that provides the title) adds to the film's air of yearning.",Take This Waltz (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,the_impossible_2012,The Impossible takes the breath away with its powerful restaging of the catastrophe; but if the wave's visceral impact knocks you off your feet then it's the story's emotional undertow that sweeps you away.,The Impossible (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,gambit_2014,"Given the calibre of those involved, this Gambit can't help but disappoint. The screenplay bears the signature of the Coen Brothers, but from the thinness and laziness of the writing I reckon it must be a forgery.",Gambit (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,hyde_park_on_hudson,When the story's leading quartet have to negotiate embarrassing moments - a handjob for Roosevelt administered by Daisy in a bouncing car; eating a hotdog at a picnic for Bertie and Liz - it's Murray's FDR who is most at ease in the sticky situations.,Hyde Park on Hudson (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,this_is_40,"There are laughs, sure, with Brooks' unabashed moocher coming up with many of the film's best lines... but the overall results are distinctly patchy and at 133 minutes, the film is at least half an hour too long.",This is 40 (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,wreck_it_ralph,"For some, Ralph's spell in Sugar Rush's candy-coloured world may induce hyperglycaemia... but hard-core gamers will have a blast picking up all the gaming in-jokes and references that fly over everyone else's heads.",Wreck-it Ralph (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,the_incredible_burt_wonderstone,"Poking fun at old-school magicians, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone pulls the odd chuckle out of the hat, but despite the starry presence of comic headliners Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey the film fails to dazzle.",The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,oz_the_great_and_powerful,"When a movie is as beloved as The Wizard of Oz, making a prequel would seem a foolhardy enterprise. Put one foot on the Yellow Brick Road and you risk stepping on your viewers' memories and dreams. Yet Raimi rises to the challenge with dash and dazzle.",Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,side_effects_2013,"One moment, we're watching an enthralling exposé of the modern pharmaceutical industry; the next we're reeling from some well-timed mystery-thriller shocks. And Soderbergh, aided by a sharp script and superb cast, wrong-foots us all the way.",Side Effects (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,silent_hill_revelation,The demon-haunted West Virginia town still gives the creeps... but this belated sequel proves to be only fitfully exciting and scary - mostly because the action stops every few minutes for yet another character to deliver reams of boring exposition.,Silent Hill: Revelation (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,fun_size,Justice makes a likeable lead but director Josh Schwartz's comic touch is distinctly leaden and a high proportion of the would-be funny scenes - some of them involving an uncredited Johnny Knoxville - fall flat.,Fun Size (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,identity_thief,"Without the irrepressible force of comic mayhem that is Melissa McCarthy, road-movie comedy Identity Thief would end up in the ditch. Luckily, the Bridesmaids co-star barrels her way through the plot's stickiest patches.",Identity Thief (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,welcome_to_the_punch,"Creevy's film certainly looks slick and stylish, but the script isn't solid enough to make the plot convincing... McAvoy is miscast. So is London.",Welcome to the Punch (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,jack_the_giant_slayer,"McGregor's dashing Elmont never loses his posh sang-froid... and with Tucci gleefully hamming it up as the villain, it's the supporting cast who are full of beans, rather than the overshadowed young leads.",Jack the Giant Slayer (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,good_vibrations_2012,"This is very much Hooley's mythic version of his own life, seen not so much through a rose-tinted lens as a brown nicotine fug... But Dormer's charm keeps us engaged and whenever there's a lull the music gives the movie a thrilling adrenaline shot.",Good Vibrations (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,gi_joe_retaliation,"Furiously loud and even more furiously dumb, G.I. Joe: Retaliation proudly flaunts the spectacular daftness we've come to expect from action movies based on toys and games.",G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,trance_2013,"Trance is dazzling to look at and has a plot that's more tangled than a game of Twister, but once you've been dazzled and have unravelled all the plot knots and kinks you're left surprisingly unsatisfied.",Trance (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,so_undercover,"To keep up her cover, Miley Cyrus's private eye has to spout nonsense like 'Totes!' and 'Amazeballs!' while pretending to be an empty-headed ditz... when the story finally gets wrapped up, 'Amazeballs' will not be the word that comes to your lips.",So Undercover (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,mental_2012,"The humour is every bit as rude and raucous as before, but Hogan's touch here seems heavy handed and the use of songs from The Sound of Music doesn't work nearly so well as the joyous Abba tunes that drove Muriel's Wedding.",Mental (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,a_late_quartet,"It's a shame that director Yaron Zilberman feels the need to raise the dramatic stakes so implausibly high, as the actors really are excellent - and the music is sublime.",A Late Quartet (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,compliance_2012,"That the events in Compliance are taking place in a fast-foot restaurant is equally resonant. The junk food we see being prepared couldn't be more disgusting. Surely, you can't help but think, anyone prepared to swallow that will swallow anything.",Compliance (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,cirque_du_soleil_worlds_away,"If the less-than-compelling plot leads you to drift off, it won't be long before another tour-de-force of agility or grace jerks you awake.",Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,broken_city,"A solidly old-fashioned crime thriller that ploughs the familiar furrow of cops, crooks and corruption in New York City.",Broken City (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,hansel_and_gretel_witch_hunters,It's an amusingly cheeky notion: the siblings from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale as witch-slaying bounty hunters. A defter hand than Wirkola's might have succeeded ... but the film's anachronisms are clumsy and most of the jokes fall flat.,Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,warm_bodies,"Warm Bodies has such a sweet and quirky spirit that it's a shame the movie isn't better. Unfortunately, Jonathan Levine fails to sustain the story's premise and the narrative pace gets stuck at a zombie shuffle.",Warm Bodies (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,hitchcock,"With Hitchcock, Gervasi, maker of beguiling rock documentary Anvil, has come up with a breezy entertainment rather than an in-depth biopic. You won't find any real insights into Hitchcock's filmmaking process or his psyche.",Hitchcock (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,i_give_it_a_year,"Mazer's wobbly quality control means that the viewer will be cringing too - Stephen Merchant, as Josh's boorish best friend, delivers a dismally unfunny best man's speech and his subsequent appearances in the story are even more toxic.",I Give It a Year (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,madagascar_3_europes_most_wanted_2012,"The action zips along, the visuals dazzle and the gags zing. The best in the series so far.",Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,run_for_your_wife_2013,"Truly dire. An offensive, witless farrago... The film's social attitudes - to homosexuality, women, marriage - appear to have been preserved in mothballs since the 1970s. Given air now, they give off an offensive odour.",Run For Your Wife (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,a_good_day_to_die_hard,"When they're not leaping off buildings in slow motion, Willis and Courtney trade the odd snarled insult or grudging endearment, but there isn't a line that lingers.",A Good Day To Die Hard (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,safe_haven,"Safe Haven may be predictable and formulaic, but Hallström gives the proceedings a cosy glow and there are a couple of twists before the end: one blindingly obvious, the other blindingly dumb.",Safe Haven (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,beautiful_creatures_2013,"Twilight with witches instead of vampires, Beautiful Creatures serves up another tale of star-crossed lovers blighted by warring supernatural cliques, mapping another invented mythology onto the hormonally charged world of teenage desires.",Beautiful Creatures (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,cloud_atlas_2012,"Tykwer and the Wachowskis take Mitchell's complex narrative and give it breathtaking momentum on screen. Admittedly, they lose the novel's element of dazzling pastiche, but they bring out its qualities of rollicking adventure and cliffhanging suspense.",Cloud Atlas (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,for_ellen,"This low-key but shrewdly observed US indie movie from Korean-American writer-director So Yong Kim pointedly opens with a man at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to take. Decision made, he soon afterwards skids into a snowdrift.",For Ellen (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,to_the_wonder,"To the Wonder displays all the familiar Malick touches - fragmentary narrative, impressionistic visuals, poetic voiceover - but this time the Malick magic is missing... Kurylenko is left to waft around dreamily like a model in a Boden catalogue shoot.",To The Wonder (2013)
jason-best,rotten,,parker_2012,"Hackford does supply some genuinely hard-boiled thrills, including the briskly efficient opening heist and a bruising hotel-room tussle for Parker and a would-be assassin. But when Lopez wiggles and pouts her way into the caper, the film goes soft.",Parker (2013)
jason-best,fresh,,robot_and_frank,"The pair's low-key crime spree provides some gentle suspense, but it's the developing friendship between the grouchy ex-thief and the robot that will beguile viewers most.",Robot & Frank (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,premium_rush,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt' fixed-wheel bike has a single gear and no brakes, and you could say the same of director David Koepp's film, which is light on character and plot. But, even on two wheels, the action is fast and furious.",Premium Rush (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,unfinished_song,"Parts of the film are cheesy and the whole is undeniably manipulative, but the film is so tender and generous, and its stars so genuinely affecting, that it's easy to forgive the odd bum note.",Unfinished Song (2013)
jason-best,fresh,4/5,frankenweenie_2012,Tim Burton's stop-motion horror homage is a quirky-jerky joy.,Frankenweenie (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,private_peaceful_2012,"If there is something a little old-fashioned and televisual about the film's family-friendly handling of its subject, the filmmakers' restraint ensures that the story remains quietly moving.",Private Peaceful (2014)
jason-best,fresh,,the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower,Where Chbosky does score is in conveying the joyful release teenagers feel on finding themselves and finding their soul-mate peers - something his characters do with the aid of the emotional touchstones provided by British post-punk classics.,The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,agora,"Agora is intelligent, stirring and, as the cultural devastation wrought by religious zealots plays out on screen, heartbreaking.",Agora (2010)
jason-best,rotten,,10010153-bitch_slap,"Jacobson and Gruendemann appear determined to put the grind into grindhouse. And not in a good way. Everything goes on so long, including an excessively protracted catfight, that the viewer will be crying for mercy before the characters do.",Bitch Slap (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,the-kreutzer-sonata-kreutzerova-sonata-,Rose films on the fly using hand-held digital video cameras - which give the scenes of marital discord a convincing immediacy. The romantic triangle may only exist inside Edgar's head but his obsessive jealousy gives Beethoven's duet a neurotic urgency.,The Kreutzer Sonata (Kreutzerova sonáta ) (1928)
jason-best,fresh,,1190561-imaginarium_of_doctor_parnassus,"The film is flawed, but you don't expect narrative drive or coherence; you go for the director's flights of fantasy. Possessed of an imagination that throws off more sparks than a fizzing, spinning Catherine Wheel, Gilliam is a fabulous fabulist.",The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009)
jason-best,rotten,,1212694-blind_side,"It's certainly a heartwarming tale and Bullock delivers a big, ballsy performance as the indomitable Tuohy - but Oscar-worthy? What were they thinking?",The Blind Side (2009)
jason-best,fresh,,no_one_knows_about_persian_cats,"Semi-improvised and shot on the run, No One Knows About Persian Cats is undeniably rough around the edges, but its raw immediacy is exhilarating.",No One Knows About Persian Cats (Les Chats Persans) (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,1203732-me_and_orson_welles,"The film's Welles is a mix of huckster and genius, thanks to an astonishing performance by little-known English actor Christian McKay, who captures his boundless self-confidence and energy. Director Richard Linklater gives his cast the chance to shine.",Me and Orson Welles (2009)
jason-best,fresh,,perriers_bounty,"At times, O'Rowe and Fitzgibbon appear to be straining too hard for effect, but at its best the film has a cartoonish vitality. The plot may be all over the place, but the cast relish O'Rowe's salty dialogue",Perrier's Bounty (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,a_serious_man,"For all the droll wit on display, it's hard to warm to the Coens' chilly parable. Is Larry's suffering the work of God or the Devil, or just the random chaos of an indifferent universe? Arch-ironists to their fingertips, the Coens aren't telling.",A Serious Man (2009)
jason-best,rotten,,1198124-shutter_island,"Scorsese keeps the tension at a pitch of near-constant hysteria. Yet when the solution to the mystery is finally revealed, you're left with a sense of disappointment",Shutter Island (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,bright_star,"Campion's film avoids any taint of costume drama frippery. Yes, Fanny starts off as a Regency-era fashionista, but Cornish and Whishaw's deeply felt performances give us a real sense of the beating hearts beneath the frock coats and bonnets.",Bright Star (2009)
jason-best,fresh,,an_education,"An Education deserves high marks. You could argue that the central relationship ought to seem sleazier, but Danish director Lone Scherfig perfectly captures the era's look and mood, Hornby's Oscar-nominated script is deft and the performances are spot on",An Education (2009)
jason-best,fresh,,10011774-chloe,Chloe starts off as an intriguing psychological drama - and then veers off into B-movie territory. Yet Moore and Neeson are such classy actors that they can't help but elevate the pulpy material.,Chloe (2010)

jason-best,rotten,,from_paris_with_love,"The goatee-sporting, shaven-headed Travolta throws himself around with gusto, and the action is bruising and bloody, but to a viewer on this side of La Manche, the film's casually racist attitude to its non-white characters is shocking.",From Paris with Love (2010)
jason-best,rotten,,its_a_wonderful_afterlife,"Chadha's recipe for the film appears to be: kooky comic supporting characters, crime, romance and essence of Ealing, together with big chunks of other films. Shame, then, that the result is a bit of a hash; more of a lumpy mish-mash than a tasty masala.",It's a Wonderful Afterlife (2010)
jason-best,rotten,,nine_2009,"Day-Lewis, over-egging the angst as well as the Eye-talian accent, is charmless and insufferable. But the person you really want to slap is Marshall, whose brash directing style simply doesn't suit Nine's more whimsical charms.",Nine (2009)
jason-best,fresh,,the_vow_2012,"The 2004 Adam-Sandler-Drew Barrymore comedy 50 First Dates played retrograde amnesia for laughs, but The Vow, loosely inspired by the experiences of real-life couple Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, aims strictly for the tear ducts.",The Vow (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,wanderlust_2011,Wanderlust takes its aim at some very broad targets so it's no wonder that the film's jokes tend to be blunt and obvious rather than rapier-sharp.,Wanderlust (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,a_dangerous_method,"Cronenberg doesn't go in for any exploding heads this time, but the surging emotions and heady ideas on display in his adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play The Talking Cure are equally combustible.",A Dangerous Method (2011)
jason-best,fresh,,the_dark_knight_rises,"Nolan gives us dazzling spectacle and gets great performances from his leads. Bale is even more impressive here than on his last two outings, the best screen Batman by far, and he's well matched by Hathaway's sexy and mischievous Catwoman.",The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
jason-best,rotten,,in_your_hands,"Psychological thriller In Your Hands finds Kristin Scott Thomas in typically excellent form, but the film itself, a claustrophobic two-hander, doesn't do her justice.",In Your Hands (Contre Toi) (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,bel_ami_2011,"As a caddish young man who seduces his way up the social ladder in late-19th-century Paris, Robert Pattinson looks much more the part than a too-old-for-the-role George Sanders in Hollywood's watered-down 1947 version, The Private Affairs of Bel Ami.",Bel Ami (2012)
jason-best,fresh,,vincere,"It's a real treat to see this provocative examination of the life of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. As Dalser, Giovanna Mezzogiorno delivers a passionate, ho-holds-barred performance. Filippo Timi is equally good as the bullish, blustering Mussolini.",Vincere (2010)

jason-best,fresh,,whatever_works,"This gleefully ironic comic fable feels different in tone from the likes of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Match Point. Woody has dusted off an old screenplay from the early 1970s that he'd originally written for Zero Mostel, shelved when the star died.",Whatever Works (2009)
jason-best,rotten,,1221547-alice_in_wonderland,"Storytelling has never been Burton's strong suit and his weakness is here compounded by a desire to somehow squeeze Carroll's topsy-turvy, logical-illogical tales into a teen-friendly, Disney-approved, big-screen adventure.",Alice in Wonderland (2010)
jason-best,fresh,,brothers_bloom,"The Brothers Bloom is quirky and clever. Set in the present but with a perfectly judged retro feel, it looks fabulous too. Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi almost steals the film with her deadpan presence as Bang Bang, the gang's explosives expert.",The Brothers Bloom (2009)
