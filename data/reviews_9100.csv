roxana-hadadi,fresh,3.5/5,april_and_the_extraordinary_world_2016,"As much as April and the Extraordinary World veers around a little too often and gets too self-indulgent with its exposition, the film effectively builds a whole other steampunk-inspired world in which viewers can get lost, gas masks and all.",April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le monde truqu√©) (2016)
