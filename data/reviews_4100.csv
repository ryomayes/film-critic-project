hannah-mcgill,rotten,2/5,the_look_of_love_2013,"A clear precursor to this film is Milos Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt, but the depth and ambiguity that film brought to its amiable monster of a protagonist just doesn't kick in here.",The Look of Love (2013)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,fill_the_void,"In the end, it's hard to determine whether Burshtein is celebrating or critiquing the insularity and strict traditions of the community that she herself joined in her 20s - but presumably that's part of the point.",Fill the Void (2013)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,,la_grande_illusion,"The film makes its moral point about the futility of combat by emphasising the interconnectedness of all humanity via such shared experiences as hunger, desire and friendship.

hannah-mcgill,fresh,4/5,kate_plays_christine,"We watch as Sheil struggles to close in on a real person to whom she bears little resemblance and about whom close to nothing is known. Sound frustrating? It is, but deliberately and cleverly so.",Kate Plays Christine (2016)
hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,valley_of_love,"It feels under-realised, and its quasi-supernatural moments have a somewhat forced air about them, but is insightful and moving about family dysfunction, long-held guilt and the instinctive intimacy that can linger between long-split lovers.",Valley Of Love (2016)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,,beach_rats_2017,"The film's mix of murky, up-close realism and dreamy vagueness is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's and Larry Clark's detailed, faintly voyeuristic depictions of teen life, as well Matt Porterfield's unvarnished but elegant portraits of urban disaffection.",Beach Rats (2017)
