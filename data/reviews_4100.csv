hannah-mcgill,rotten,3/5,shell,"Perhaps it's appropriate to a degree given the film's desolate and unpopulated setting, but there isn't quite enough content here to fill out feature length.",Shell (2013)

hannah-mcgill,rotten,2/5,the_look_of_love_2013,"A clear precursor to this film is Milos Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt, but the depth and ambiguity that film brought to its amiable monster of a protagonist just doesn't kick in here.",The Look of Love (2013)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,fill_the_void,"In the end, it's hard to determine whether Burshtein is celebrating or critiquing the insularity and strict traditions of the community that she herself joined in her 20s - but presumably that's part of the point.",Fill the Void (2013)
hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,lovelace,"It's a somewhat simplistic dichotomy but Amanda Seyfried does a good job managing the contradictions of her character, and her co-stars Sharon Stone and Peter Sarsgaard keep the pace.",Lovelace (2013)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,town_of_runners_2012,"The filmmakers achieve intimacy without condescension, and capture both heartrending hopefulness and sad self-delusion. An interesting if slightly limited corrective to sanctimonious Olympics hype.",Town Of Runners (2012)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,,la_grande_illusion,"The film makes its moral point about the futility of combat by emphasising the interconnectedness of all humanity via such shared experiences as hunger, desire and friendship.

hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,la_delicatesse,"Despite this rather yucky premise, the film musters not inconsiderable charm - Tautou is not mis-sold as an irresistible love object, and Nathalie's workplace and family life are warmly and observantly drawn.",La délicatesse (Delicacy) (2012)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,brave_2012,"Story isn't Brave's strong suit - it relies too heavily on a rather random-feeling deus ex machina - but its gloss, confidence and sense of fun go a long way to compensate.",Brave (2012)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,4/5,the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower,"Its romance regarding the significance of teen experience might not work on everyone, but its earnestness, wit and stirring music ought to leave few hearts wholly untouched.",The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)
hannah-mcgill,rotten,2/5,the_campaign,"Hits an occasional vein of funny, but for the most part it's inescapably half-assed, largely relying for laughs on Ferrell's familiar schtick of delivering filth in deadpan tones.",The Campaign (2012)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,4/5,kate_plays_christine,"We watch as Sheil struggles to close in on a real person to whom she bears little resemblance and about whom close to nothing is known. Sound frustrating? It is, but deliberately and cleverly so.",Kate Plays Christine (2016)
hannah-mcgill,fresh,3/5,valley_of_love,"It feels under-realised, and its quasi-supernatural moments have a somewhat forced air about them, but is insightful and moving about family dysfunction, long-held guilt and the instinctive intimacy that can linger between long-split lovers.",Valley Of Love (2016)

hannah-mcgill,fresh,,beach_rats_2017,"The film's mix of murky, up-close realism and dreamy vagueness is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's and Larry Clark's detailed, faintly voyeuristic depictions of teen life, as well Matt Porterfield's unvarnished but elegant portraits of urban disaffection.",Beach Rats (2017)
