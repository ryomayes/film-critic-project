michael-arbeiter,fresh,3/5,snatched_2017,"As a showcase of the screen presences of Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer, it has much of what you expect it offer. And as a story about a mother and a daughter reconnecting, it has more.",Snatched (2017)
michael-arbeiter,rotten,2/5,pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales,"So hollow are Henry Turner, Carina, and at this point Jack Sparrow that there's not nearly as much joy as there should be in watching them run amok across the land and sea.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017)
michael-arbeiter,rotten,2.5/5,cars_3,"While Pixar is hardly averse to treating its audience surrogates to the pangs of growing up, Lightning's isn't a reflection of the new worlds that young viewers might themselves be taking on.",Cars 3 (2017)

michael-arbeiter,fresh,3.5/5,the_greatest_showman_2017,"Thus, we're left with a film that claims greatness, but has nothing great to show for itself. And yet, mathematics be damned, I'm hesitant to submit to the fact that The Greatest Showman isn't, in fact, great.",The Greatest Showman (2017)
