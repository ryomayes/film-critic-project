john-walsh,fresh,4/5,capitalism_a_love_story,"Moore is marvellously indignant and confrontational (he tries to make a citizen's arrest of the AIG board), and dramatises moments of rebellion and fight-back with relish. But there's something self-righteous and teenage-lefty about his rhetoric.",Capitalism: A Love Story (2009)
john-walsh,fresh,3/5,micmacs,Nobody beats [Jeunet] for sheer comic inventiveness and the speed with which he whips ideas into crazy reality. The only problem with his approach is that black humour clearly isn't enough for him.,Micmacs (Micmacs à tire-larigot) (2010)

john-wenzel,rotten,1.5/4,passengers_2016,"At best, Passengers is glib and cutesy in the face of otherwise serious themes. At worst, it's an argument that men can do whatever they want with the knowledge that things will always work out for them.",Passengers (2016)
john-wenzel,fresh,3/4,patriots_day_2016,"It's not exploitative or overtly political, and the violence is both sickening and sad. That's what makes it effective, but also impressive as a still-fresh take on a recent tragedy, messy as it is.",Patriots Day (2017)
